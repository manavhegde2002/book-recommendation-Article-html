<h2>1)THE SUBTLE ART OF NOT GIVING A FUCK<h2>
<h3>by Author Mark Manson</h3>
<br>
<h2>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is a book by Mark Manson that presents an unrelenting array of counterintuitive arguments supported by profound case studies and analogies1. The book is anti self-esteem, anti positive thinking, anti believing in yourself, anti goal setting, and encourages people to say "no" more often and think about their own death.<h2>

<h2>2)THE TIME MACHINE<h2>
<h3>by Author HG Wells</h3>

<br>
<h2>'The Time Machine' is one book that offers a lot of enjoyment to the reader. From the richly packed romance between the time traveler and Weena to the unexpected run-ins with a mischievous bunch of evolved humans called Morlocks down to several time trips in an actual time machine. This is one book that is century-plus old but its pages and stories therein are always fresh and exciting when it's looked up.<h2>
